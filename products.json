Winner of 2021 AK Leaf Cannabis Bowl Inspired by the popular ’90s strain Tangerine Dream, Tangie is a distinctly aromatic bud with strong, unmistakable notes of citrus and tangerine. Bred by Amsterdam’s DNA Genetics and available in both regular and feminized seeds, Tangie crosses a select cut of Crockett’s Farm Tangerine Dream with DNA Genetics’ select male Skunk to create a citrusy plant with high yields of resinous flowers. The original Tangerine Dream was a cross between Skunk #1 and California Orange (also known as Cali-O). Tangie inspired the creation of several citrusy hybrids, including Sour Tangie (East Coast Sour Diesel crossed with Tangie,) Tangie OG (Tangie and OG Kush) and Agent Tangie (Agent Orange plus Tangie).",
